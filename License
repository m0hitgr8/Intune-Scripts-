Hi Team,

We have reviewed the proposed approach to exclude users associated with Cloud PC (W365) from the Windows 10/11 Enterprise license assignment to avoid license shortfall.

However, we would like to highlight an important scenario that needs to be addressed before finalising the scope.

There is a subset of users who currently have both a Cloud PC and a physical (laptop) device assigned to them. If we exclude the group containing Cloud PC users entirely, these dual-device users will also be excluded from the Windows Enterprise license assignment, even though their physical devices still require the Windows 10/11 Enterprise license.

This could result in:

Physical devices falling out of licensing compliance

Potential activation or feature downgrade on those devices

Increased operational and audit risk

To avoid this, we recommend:

Ensuring users who have both Cloud PC and physical devices are explicitly included in the Windows 10/11 Enterprise license assignment scope, or

Using a more granular targeting approach (for example, device-based or filtered groups) that assigns licenses only to physical Windows endpoints, while excluding Cloud PC–only users.

Please let us know if you would like us to propose a revised group structure or filtering logic to support this requirement.
