Efficiency Mode
Reduces CPU usage and power consumption during browsing
Slight reduction in background tab priority
Enabled – Provides performance optimisation without impacting active tabs
Sleeping Tabs
Frees memory from inactive tabs after inactivity
Inactive tabs may reload when revisited
Enabled – Reload behaviour is expected and does not affect active usage
Tab Lifecycle Management
Prioritises resources for active tabs and applications
Inactive tabs deprioritised
Enabled – Improves responsiveness of foreground workloads
Startup Boost
Faster Edge launch time
Consumes memory during system startup
Disabled – Avoids unnecessary background resource usage at login
Hard Memory Limit for Edge
Prevents Edge from consuming excessive memory
Can cause tab reloads or reduced responsiveness during high-memory, multi-tab workloads
Not enforced – Risk to active user experience outweighs benefit at this stage
