Google Chrome Assignment Process

1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define a controlled and standardised process for assigning Google Chrome to end-user devices. This ensures consistency, avoids policy conflicts, and simplifies troubleshooting and compliance management.

⸻

2. Scope

This process applies to:
	•	All Windows devices managed via Microsoft Intune
	•	All user and device groups eligible for Google Chrome deployment
	•	IT administrators responsible for application deployment and access management

⸻

3. Standard Assignment Model
	•	Google Chrome must be assigned to only one dedicated Azure AD / Entra ID group.
	•	This group will be the single source of assignment for Chrome deployment.
	•	No additional user or device groups are permitted for Chrome assignment under any circumstances.

⸻

4. Assignment Rules
	•	Chrome must not be assigned to:
	•	Multiple user groups
	•	Multiple device groups
	•	Dynamic groups overlapping with the primary Chrome group
	•	Mixing Required and Available assignments across different groups is strictly prohibited.
	•	Any exception to this rule must go through formal approval and change management.

⸻

5. Rationale

Following a single-group assignment approach:
	•	Prevents deployment conflicts and unexpected install/uninstall behavior
	•	Ensures predictable application delivery
	•	Reduces troubleshooting complexity
	•	Avoids inconsistent versioning and policy enforcement
	•	Aligns with Intune best practices for application management

⸻

6. Monthly Review Process
	•	The Chrome assignment group will be reviewed once every month.
	•	The review will validate:
	•	Group membership accuracy
	•	Business justification for all assigned users/devices
	•	Removal of inactive or no-longer-required accounts
	•	Any discrepancies identified during the review will be corrected immediately.

⸻

7. Change Management
	•	Any request to modify:
	•	The Chrome assignment group
	•	Assignment type (Required / Available)
	•	Deployment scope
must follow the approved Change Management Process.
	•	Emergency changes must be documented and reviewed retrospectively.

⸻

8. Compliance
	•	Non-compliance with this process may result in:
	•	Application deployment failures
	•	User impact
	•	Audit findings
	•	Repeated deviations will be escalated to the service owner.

⸻

9. Ownership
	•	Application Owner: Endpoint Management Team
	•	Review Frequency: Monthly
	•	Document Review Cycle: Quarterly or as required
