Dear Team,

Following the recent DST transition, we identified an opportunity to further strengthen time synchronization consistency on UK devices.

As part of a continuous improvement initiative, we have implemented an Intune proactive remediation automation that periodically validates and maintains correct time configuration. The automation:
- Ensures devices are set to GMT Standard Time (UK with DST support)
- Confirms automatic DST adjustment is enabled
- Verifies the Windows Time service is running and triggers a resynchronization if required

This runs silently in the background and prevents the need for manual device-level interventions during future DST changes.

- User impact: None  
- Risk level: Low  
- Rollback: Automation can be disabled if required  

Please let us know if any further details are needed.

Kind regards,  
Mohit Srivastava  
Intune Operations

If you want an even shorter exec summary (3–4 lines) or a one-liner for a status deck, I can trim it further.
