At the moment, this issue appears to be isolated to a single user and is not observed more broadly. As a precaution, I’ve already raised a packaging request for the updated driver so we can validate it in a controlled manner and keep it ready if required.

That said, given the behaviour (keyboard and mouse not being detected consistently on boot), there is also a strong possibility that this could be hardware-related. It would be worth having the WPS team check the dock, cables, and port behaviour to rule out any physical or firmware-related issues.

Once the driver package is ready, we can still test it on the affected device to conclusively verify whether it resolves the problem before considering any wider rollout.

Please let me know if you’d like me to coordinate with WPS for the hardware checks.
