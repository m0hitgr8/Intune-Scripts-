This policy was created based on the requirement raised under work orders WO0000000138083 and WO0000000138421 for the group PERM-D-OpenText-SysTest-Commercial-xECM-ReadWrite-Only.

The OpenText users required the Content Server Browser Web Extension.

Initially, the extension was permitted under the standard Microsoft Edge policy, allowing manual installation from the Edge Add-ons store. However, since this is a Chrome-based extension, it was not getting installed successfully through the standard store flow. Users were experiencing delays as the extension was not being provisioned.

To resolve this, we configured the extension using the Edge ADMX-backed policy by adding it to the ExtensionInstallForcelist along with the appropriate update URL (Chrome Web Store URL format). This ensures:
	•	Silent installation in the background
	•	No user interaction required
	•	Controlled deployment of only the approved extension ID
	•	No relaxation of existing CIS-aligned security controls

For testing and controlled rollout, we created a separate policy (open-text-edgepolicy) and scoped it specifically to the OpenText user group. This was done to ensure that:
	•	The extension installs only for the required users
	•	Other standard users are not impacted
	•	The broader Edge baseline remains unchanged
	•	The implementation follows a least-privilege and scoped exception model

The deployment was successful for the targeted group.

Please let me know if you would like a walkthrough of the exact configuration or if we should review incorporating this into a broader standardized Edge policy framework.
