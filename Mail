As part of our ongoing CSI (Continual Service Improvement) initiative for the Microsoft Edge Performance Optimisation, we have created a test Intune configuration policy with targeted settings designed to enhance and optimise overall Microsoft Edge performance.

Please find attached the draft version of the Microsoft Edge Performance Optimisation – Technical Document, which provides a detailed overview of:
	•	The test configuration and implemented Edge performance settings
	•	Technical justification aligned with Microsoft-supported best practices
	•	Before and after validation methodology and observed outcomes

We kindly request you to review the document and let us know if any additional data points, metrics, or validation artefacts are required from your end.

We will be happy to incorporate any feedback or provide further technical details as needed.
